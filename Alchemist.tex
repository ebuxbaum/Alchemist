\maketitle

The symbols used by alchemists served as \Foreign{aide memoir} for the researchers themself and for communication, even across language barriers. At the same time, however, their meaning was hidden except to a small group of specially trained practitioners. A list of alchemist symbols can be found on \parencite{Sym-23} and even more extensive ones in \parencite{Ano-72, Get-81, Mar-20}. A few are standardised in unicode as miscellaneous symbols (''2600 -- ''26FF (astrology) and ''1F700 -- ''1F77F (alchemy)) \parencite{Uni-22}.  A list of synonyms for old chemical names in several languages can be found  in \parencite{Ant-62}, a dictionary of alchemical terms in \parencite{Rul-12}.

The biggest difficulty understanding alchemist manuscripts is the inconsistent chemical nomenclature: the same name and symbol was used for different things (homonyms, for example, magnesia usually means \chemical{MgO}, but could also mean metallic bismuth), and many different trivial names and symbols existed for the same chemical (synonyms). I am sure, this resulted in the occasional lab explosion... In addition, orthography was, uhm, creative before it became standardised in the 19th century (in Germany with \parencite{Dud-80}).

Hermetic symbols are often derived from a few basic archetypes that were combined (see fig. \ref{fig:arche}). \Name{Gettings} \parencite[324--410]{Get-81} tries to systematise the symbols by first counting the number of strokes (1--5) and then subdivide each of these groups on geometric grounds. However, what constitutes one or several strokes seems somewhat arbitrary. Also, for more than 3 strokes, the number of possible subdivisions explodes.

For this collection, I have left out symbols closely related to those included, for example, by addition or removal of serifs or by rotation. Of course, this choice is somewhat arbitrary.

\subsection{Zodiac signs}

Western zodiac signs originate from the Babylonians (``Chaldea'' in Greek terms, in today's form \(\approx\) \num{400} BC) and also have hellenistic influences. The constellations are located near the solar ekliptic (from Gr. \foreignlanguage{greek}{ἐκλειπτική τροχιά} ekleiptikē trochiá), the path that the sun apparently moves on during the year. Each of the signs occupies \ang{30} of celestial longitude, due to the earth's orbital eccentricity corresponding to \SI{20.4}{d} for Capricorn to \SI{31.4}{d} for cancer.

A horoskop (from Gr. \foreignlanguage{greek}{ὥρα σκοπεῖν} hōra skopéin = marker of the hour [of birth]) or natal chart was based on the theory that the movement of heavenly objects was causally linked to the events on earth (``like above, so below''). For this purpose were determined the
\begin{itemize}
  \item{\Foreign{prima domus} (first house, ascendant), intersection of ekliptic and horizon, east angle}
  \item{\Foreign{medium coeli} (midheaven, 10th house), intersection of meridian and ekliptic, north angle}
  \item{Descendant, setting sign, west angle }
  \item{\Foreign{imum coeli} (opposite of \Foreign{medium coeli}), south angle}
\end{itemize}
as function of time and place of birth, using the geocentric perspective. Together, these form a cross.

If the plane defined by the orbit of a celestial body has an angle (inclination) \(\neq 0\) to a reference plane, then the orbit intersects the reference plane in two points. The one crossed by the north-moving body is called the ascending node (Latin \Foreign{caput draconis} = dragon's head or Greek \foreignlanguage{greek}{αναβιβάζων} anabibazōn). The node of the south-moving body is called descending node (\Foreign{cauda draconis} = dragon's tail or \foreignlanguage{greek}{καταβιβάζων} katabibazōn). In astrology, these terms refer to the crossings of the orbit of the moon with the apparent orbit of the sun across the sky.

The orbit of a celestial body around another is an ellipse and as such has two focal points. One is occupied by the heavier (resting) body, the second is called the \emph{lilith}. It is empty and of no significance in astronomy. In astrology, however, the second focal point of the moon's orbit around earth is called \emph{black moon lilith}.

In extensive scientific studies, if proper blinding is used, there is no significant (beyond what is expected randomly) connection between a horoskop and the character or biography of a person \parencite{Car-83, Fic-83, Wun-08}. In particular, statements about personality are so vague and general that most people will believe they were tailored to them \parencite{For-49} (\Name{Barnum}-effect, named after showman \Name{Phineas Taylor Barnum}, 1810--1891).

\section{Compounds}

In general, \emph{crocus of} or \emph{saffron of} means a yellow compound, \emph{magistery of} a compound purified by precipitation, \emph{magistry of} a compound synthesised from the element and hence without impurities. \emph{Flores} or \emph{flower of} means substances purified by sublimation. \emph{Mercury of} refers to philosophical mercury and can mean anything. \emph{Spritus} refers to volatile compounds, \emph{dead} substances are those where the spiritus (life) has been removed by heating. \emph{Hepar} = liver are brownish substances, often containing sulphur. \emph{Calx} = ashes are substances that have been heated until they glowed. A regulus is a metal drop after smelting.

Vitriol are sulphates, often named by their colour: green -- iron, blue -- copper, white -- zinc, red -- cobalt. Also named by their origin: roman -- iron, cyprian -- copper. Hungarian vitriol was originally copper sulphate, but as the copper in the mines was depleted in the 18th century, it contained more and more iron.

\section{Concepts}

Greek cosmology is described in the \foreignlanguage{greek}{Τίμαιος} (Tímaios) by \foreignlanguage{greek}{Πλάτων} \textsc{Plátōn} (ca. \num{428}--\num{348} BC) \parencite{Pla-40}, but goes back to earlier philosophers (\foreignlanguage{greek}{Ἐμπεδοκλῆς} Empedoklḗs ca. \num{490}--\num{430} BC, \foreignlanguage{greek}{Δημόκριτος} Dēmókritos ca. \num{460}--\num{370} BC). Assume a cube of some material, say, iron. This cube could be cut in halves, those halves into halves again, and so on. However, this is not possible \Foreign{ad infinitum}, but at some point one would reach a limit, where further division is no longer possible. These smallest possible particles are called atoms (from Greek \foreignlanguage{greek}{ἄτομος} átomos = undividable). There are \num{4} kinds of atoms, shaped like those \textsc{Platon}ic bodies constructed from triangles: tetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron and cube. These different atomic shapes correspond to the 4 elements: the atoms of fire are tetrahedrons (prickly) , soil cubes (tessellates Euclidean space and causes the solidity of the soil), water icosahedras (flows out of the hands like little balls) and air octahedrons (smooth, can hardly be felt). Each of those elements embodies a particular combination of the primary qualities hot -- cold and wet -- dry: air is hot and wet, fire hot and dry, soil dry and cold and water wet and cold. Air is gaseous, water liquid and soil solid, fire is consuming. Fire represents the male, water the female principle, air and soil are transition elements.

Each of the basic elements is also associated with one of the 4 bodily fluids that must be in balance to avoid disease, they also correspond to temperaments: blood -- air -- sanguinic, black gall -- soil -- melancholic, yellow gall -- fire -- choleric and slime -- water -- phlegmatic (humoral pathology, \foreignlanguage{greek}{Ἱπποκράτης} Hippokrates \num{460}--\num{370} BC, \foreignlanguage{greek}{Γαληνός} \textsc{Galenos}, \num{129}--\num{199} AD, \foreignlanguage{arabic}{أبو علي الحسين بن عبد الله ابن سينا} Abū Alī al-Husain ibn Abd Allāh ibn Sīnā (Avicenna) \num{980}--\num{1037} AD).

The fifth platonic body -- dodecaeder -- is not composed of triangles, is considered the most noble and represents the cosmos or the spirit.

Alchemy had three goals:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{the preparation of chemicals, often in the context of practical purposes (\Foreign{e.g.}, metals and dyes). This is now handled by chemistry.}
  \item{the preparation of medicines that can cure diseases. This is now dealt with by pharmacology.}
  \item{the transmutation of base metals (like lead) into noble metals like silver and gold (Gr. \foreignlanguage{greek}{χρῡσός} khrūsós = gold and \foreignlanguage{greek}{ποιέω} pœia = I make: chrysopoeia = gold making; \foreignlanguage{greek}{ἄργῠρος} árguros = silver: argyropoeia = silver making). Today we understand that this requires the transformation of elements (nuclei with different number of protons), which is not possible by chemistry. Nuclear physics can do so in particle accelerators by bombarding bismuth with high energy atoms to kick out \num{4} protons and \num{6}--\num{9} neutrons from the \isotope[209][83]{Bi}-nuclei to produce a variety of \isotope[][79]{Au}-isotopes, of which only \isotope[197][79]{Au} is not radioactive \parencite{Ale-81}. Also, the process requires vast amounts of energy (worth about US\$ \num{5000} per \si{h}, for \SI{1}{d} to produce a few thousand gold atoms) and is thus not cost effective. For true alchemists, however, transmutation was only a symbol for obtaining spiritual enlightenment by liberating ones essence from the worldly personality.}
\end{itemize}
A good impression of alchemist working methods and chemical knowledge of the late 16th century gives \parencite{Rei-96}, which should be read with the explanations in \parencite{Sou-22}. The alchemical work of the ``last of the magicians'', \Name{Isaac Newton}, is discussed in \parencite{New-18}. For an extensive discussion of the laboratories and equipment used in various periods, see \parencite{Mor-21}. Direct translation of these old recipes into modern terminology, however, may not yield the expected result. The chemicals available to alchemists were often impure, and these impurities often formed a vital ingredient \parencite{Pri-87}!.

Later authors added the quintessence, an eternal substance that forms the basis of the other elements. \Name{Philippus Theophrastus Aureolus Bombast von Hohenheim (Paracelsus)} \num{1493}--\num{1541} \parencite{Mic-21} replaced the 4 elements from antiquity with the \Foreign{tria prima} (original trias) mercury (volatile), sulfur (burning) and salt (stabilising). He didn't mean the substances we take from the lab shelf, but their ``philosophical'' equivalent. Key to this was a hypothetical universal solvent, the \Foreign{liquor alchahest}, which could extract philosophical elements from everyday material, which could then be purified and made available for recombination \parencite{Por-02}. \Name{Joan Baptista van Helmont} (\num{1579}–-\num{1644}) developed this idea further, before it eventually fell into disfavour. How would one contain a solvent that dissolved literally everything? The difference between dissolution and decomposition was shady before modern atomic theory!

\Name{Paracelsus} based medicine on observation rather than philosophical book wisdom and explored the pharmaceutical use of minerals, complementing the plants suggested by \Name{Galenos}. He introduced the concept that substances toxic in higher doses may be curative in low (\Foreign{dosis sola facit venenum} \parencite{Par-74}, only the dose makes the poison) and is the father of modern toxicology. In particular, he experimented with mercury against the ``French disease'' (syphilis), but the results were, at best, variable. It is thus not surprising that \Name{Paracelsus} died from chronic exposure to mercury vapours as attested by the \chemical{Hg}-concentration in his bones.

Note that philosophical sulphur, salt and mercury have nothing to do with the chemicals we know under those names. For example, according to \Name{Frater Albertus Spargyricus} (worldly name \Name{Albert Richard Riedel}, \num{1911}--\num{1984}), all three can be isolated from sage leaves (``mountain sage'', genus \Species{Salvia} L. (Lamiaceae), unclear exactly which of the 900 species is meant). The leaves are first subjected to steam distillation to get the essential oil (= alchemical sulphur), the leaves are then fermented and the alcohol formed rectified (= alchemical mercury). The reminder is calcinated, extracted with water and crystallised to get potash (= alchemical salt).

Production of the philosopher's stone  goes through phases distinguished by their colour: black (\Foreign{caput corvi} = raven head), iridescent (\Foreign{cauda pavonis} = peacock tail), white (\Foreign{albedo}, the product is now able to transmute base metals to silver), yellow (\Foreign{citrinalis}) and finally scarlet red (rubedo, \Foreign{sol philosoporum}, phœnix). Before use, the phœnix should be diluted with thousand-times the amount of gold by melting them together, lest it be too strong.

\section{Elements}

The alchemist's idea about elements (atoms shaped like different \Name{Platon}ic bodies) was very different from ours (different number of protons in the nucleus). In the following, we list elements in our modern understanding. Even then, however, there can be misunderstandings. ``Regulus of antimony'' is quite clear, a drop of antimony left after purification. However, ``regulus of iron'' and ``regulus of copper'' also mean antimony, but made by reducing antimony oxyde with iron or copper, respectively. It was assumed that they were different because of the different synthetic route.

The symbols for iron/Mars and copper/Venus are also used for male and female.

\section{Metals}

Note that many alchemists did not strictly differentiate between copper, brass and bronze (similar to the outdated English term `latten'). Thus, the signs for these, and even the Latin word \Foreign{æs},  may simply mean ``metal''.

\section{Process}

As mentioned, the \Foreign{opus magnum} of gold making is really only an allegory of the journey to self-knowledge and, yes, eventually also to god \parencite{Rip-71, Jun-44}. It required moral characteristics like faith, devotedness, diligence and discreetness, but beyond that also an accreditation by God \parencite{Das-unk}. For various authors the \Foreign{opus magnum} would take 7 days (like creation), 9 months (like pregnancy) or one year (like the cycle of nature).

\begin{description}
  \item[Calcination]{exposure of a sample to high, dry heat in the absence of oxygen /roasting is the equivalent with air access). Many substances under these condition loose weight, turn white and become easy to grind. First (black) stage of the \Foreign{opus magnum}. The colour black represents chaos and death, and that what is hidden or buried, the \Foreign{materia prima} from which all other things may be obtained. Spiritually, calcination means burning off our attachments to the world: the desire for status, fame, wealth and identity. Our preconceived notions about ourself are put to the test by fire, in an existential crisis, in the \emph{dark night of the soul}. However, calcination cannot only be achieved by an actual, but also by a potential (corrosive chemicals) or philosophical fire (materials hung over boiling water until they softened).)}
  \item[Decoction]{boiling of chopped, hard plant materials (wood, bark, roots), usually in water, for about \num{1}--\SI{2}{h}. From Lat. \Foreign{decoquere} "to boil down". If the boiling water is merely poured over the plant material and left to soak for \num{5}--\SI{10}{min}, we speak of \emph{infusions}, this is used for soft plant material like flowers or leafs. \emph{Percolation} means that the boiling water is filtered through the (often ground) material. In either case, about 1 teaspoon of material is used per cup.  }
  \item[Dissolution]{forming a solution. In the \Foreign{opus magnum}, the ashes obtained during calcination are extracted with water, the symbol of the unconscious or hidden. In European alchemy this is seen in analogy to the creation report in Gen 1\textsubscript{2}: \emph{And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters}. Spiritually, we free ourselves from our inauthentic and acquired traits. The dissolution stage involves freeing repressed emotions from traumatic events that we have pushed down into our subconsciousness (dissolution of the ego \parencite{Jun-44}), and can be a cathartic step.}
  \item[Separation]{is the 3rd stage of the \Foreign{opus magnum}, where the products of dissolution are filtered and separated. Whilst the first stages were associated with the elements fire and water, this one is associated with air. The pure essence is extracted from the mixture. Spiritually, we leave our acquired personality in form of engrained thought processes and emotional triggers to become our true, essential self. Collect all the things in you that are helpful for yourself and for others, and let go of everything else. After the turmoil of the first steps, we can now enjoy the stillness of being removed from all that is inauthentic and artificial. }
  \item[Conjunction]{means bringing together the elements purified in the first three stages by fire, water and air in the sign of the soil. Spiritually, we bring what is left of us together to form a new, authentic personality. The conflict of dualities like body and soul, spirit and matter, conscious and unconscious are resolved. Feminine qualities like emotion and intuition join male like intellect and logic.  }
  \item[Fermentation]{exposure to microorganisms for longer time to achieve a chemical reaction and remove what is no longer needed. }
  \item[Putrefaction]{leaving a sample undisturbed, often after adding the desired material (seed). Both fermentation and putrefaction form the 5th stage of the \Foreign{opus magnum}: the removal of the old, unauthentic self. This process can be painful, but we cannot see dawn before we have gone through the darkest of nights. }
  \item[Distillation]{process of vaporising and then condensing a substance. The different boiling points of the components of a mixture are used for purification of the essence. In spiritual alchemy, our core identity is freed from any inferior elements. The ego is no longer dominating, so that the soul can be heard. }
  \item[Coagulation]{old term for crystallisation. The result is the philosopher's stone. Spiritually, the self comes together in a healing process. This is called \emph{rubedo}. This word also refers to the state achieved by the mage where he is fully attuned to the \Foreign{anima mundi}, the fountainhead of creation and source of the \Foreign{prima materia}. }
\end{description}

Apart from the processes involved in the \Foreign{opus magnum}, the following methods were used by alchemists:
\begin{description}
  \item[Ceration]{allowing a hard, dry substance to absorb water while it is heated (imbibition) for the purpose of softening it (from Latin \Foreign{cera} = wax). }
  \item[Circulation]{The sample is heated, any vapours produced are condensed and drip back into the reaction vessel. }
  \item[Cohobation]{A sample is distilled, the collected volatile components are added back to the residue and the process is repeated. Not used in modern chemistry.}
  \item[Cupellation]{Separation of noble from base metals. The sample is molten in a crucible from calcareous material like bone ash to oxydise base metals, the molten oxydes are wicked away by the crucible and a regulus of the pure noble metal remains. The process may also be used to assay the noble metal content of a sample.}
  \item[Digestion]{heating a sample in an open vessel for long times, but without boiling it.}
  \item[Disposition]{}
  \item[Dissolve]{disperse a solute in a solvent to make a solution. Contrary to dissolution, it is expected that the solute is (at least almost) completely soluble in the solvent (if enough solvent is added), whilest dissolution intents to separate the sample into a soluble and insoluble fraction. }
  \item[dulcify]{remove soluble, in particular acidic, components by extraction with water }
  \item[Fixation]{turning a volatile compound into a solid that does not loose weight in fire}
  \item[Lixivation]{extraction to separate soluble and insoluble material. The soluble product is the \emph{lixivium} }
  \item[macerate]{soften by steeping in liquid, with or without heat }
  \item[Multiplication]{increasing the potency of an elixir or philosopher's stone, often by repeating the process by which it was originally obtained}
  \item[Precipitation]{letting a solid form from a solution and collecting it. }
  \item[Projection]{process of transmuting base metals to gold using the philosopher's stone}
  \item[Purify]{increasing the concentration of a particular substance, if possible close to \SI{100}{\%}. }
  \item[Regulus formation]{getting the pure form of a metal (especially antimony) out of an ore. The left-over is called \emph{scoria} or \emph{slag}. }
  \item[Solution]{one component (solute) is homogenously dispersed in a second component (solvent, usually, but not necessarily, a liquid). }
  \item[Sublimation]{heating a substance to turn it from the solid directly into the gaseous state and back, without forming a liquid first. The sublimate is called ``flower''.}
  \item[Tincture]{extract in alcohol.}
  \item[Trituration]{grinding several substances together to obtain a homogeneous powder with reduced particle size. For example, hormones are often effective in very small doses that cannot be handled. Triturating them with a several hundred- or even thousand-fold excess of an inert material, say sugar, solves that problem.  }

\section{Tools}

\begin{description}
  \item[Alembic]{from Greek \foreignlanguage{greek}{ἄμβιξ} ambix = beaker over Arabic \foreignlanguage{arabic}{الإنبيق} al-inbīq is a distillation apparatus consisting of two vessels connected by a bridge with downward-sloping tube (\foreignlanguage{greek}{σωλήν} sōlēn). In the fist (cucurbit from \foreignlanguage{greek}{βῖκος} bîkos) a sample was heated, the second (receiver, from \foreignlanguage{greek}{φιάλη} phialē over Arabic \foreignlanguage{arabic}{قَابِلَة} qābila) received the vapours condensed in a connecting tube. Its invention is attributed to \Name{Maria Prophetissa} of Alexandria in the 1st century AD (variously also called \Name{Maria the Jewess} or \Name{Maria the Copt}). The bridge of modern chemical glassware is the closest equivalent. The pot still used in modern alcohol production is derived from the alembic. }
  \item[Athanor]{furnace with three chambers, for ash, fire and sample. They were constructed from bricks held together by clay. From the 16th century onward, the temperature could be regulated by variable slits for air, the \Foreign{Piger Henricus } (Lazy Henry) had an opening from which the charcoal could drop into the fire chamber automatically, so that the alchemist did not have to tend the fire every few hours. }
  \item[\Foreign{Balneum mariæ}]{hot water bath allegedly invented by \Name{Maria Prophetissa} and still used to keep food warm in refectories and the like (\Foreign{bain de Marie}). It consists of an outer vessel half-filled with a hot fluid (usually water) and an inner vessel that is filled with the material to be kept warm and immersed in the fluid of the outer vessel. The material in the inner vessel is kept at a constant temperature, without hot or cold spots. Sometimes also called by the malapropisms \Foreign{balneum maris, balneum virginis}.}
  \item[\Foreign{Balneum roris, balneum vaporosum}]{steam bath. Used for medical purposes to evaporate essential oils to be breathed by the patient, but also for temperatures in between the water bath (\Foreign{balneum mariæ}) and the sand bath (\Foreign{balneum arenæ}, constructed like the \Foreign{balneum mariæ} but with sand instead of water). }
  \item[Caduceus]{is the staff of Hermes (Gr.) = Mercury (Lat., god of traders and thieves) with two snakes and wings. It should not be mixed up with the staff of Asclepios (Son of Apollo) with one snake and no wings, which is a symbol of medicine. The astrological/alchemists sign of Mercury is an older version of the caduceus, with the snakes protruding from the staff (originally two branches wound together by envoys, similar to our \emph{white flag}).}
  \item[Matrass]{glass flask with a round body and a long neck}
  \item[Retort]{(from Lat. \Foreign{retortus} = curved backward) glass vessel used by alchemists. Heating it was an art in itself, as the soda-lime glasses available at the time were liable to crack when heated unevenly. In the modern chemical industry, vessels of any shape and material used for pyrolysis are still called retort (production of shale oil, charcoal, recovery of \chemical{Hg} in gold mining). In the laboratory, the \Name{Liebig} condenser has largely replaced the retort. }
  \item[Reverberatory furnace]{metallurgical oven where the fire and sample chamber are side-by-side. The heat and flue gasses are reflected into the sample chamber and from there into the flue. This separates the sample from the fuel (unlike the blast furnace), but not the flue gasses and fly ash. The \Name{Siemens-Martin} oven is a special kind of reverberatory furnace, where oxydising flue gasses are used to remove the carbon and thus convert pig iron to steel (puddling). }
  \item[Scepter of Jove]{or bident, a pitchfork-like instrument with two prongs, was used in Roman time for the consecration of a place struck by lightning. It is probably a symbol for Jupiter's lightning bolt. The name may be derived from the young sheep sacrificed in the ritual (so young as to have only two teeth). The bident is also the symbol for Hades (Pluto), the god of the underworld. }
  \item[Staff of Asclepios]{Staff with a snake (allegedly a Aesculapian adder \Foreign{Zamenis longissimus} (\Name{Laurenti}, 1768), Colubridae)  wound around it. Originally, the ``snake'' is probably a Guinea worm (\Foreign{Dracunculus medinensis} L., Dracunculidae), which already in ancient Egypt was removed from affected limbs by slowly pulling it out and winding it around a piece of wood. }
  \item[Trident ]{is similar to the bident, but has three prongs. It is the symbol of Poseidon (Neptune), god of the seas. }
  \item[Starred Trident ]{}
  \item[\Foreign{Venter equinus}]{Horse dung bath. Decomposition of organic material delivers a gentle, long-lasting warmth.}
  \item[Wind furnace]{blast furnace that used natural strong winds (\Foreign{i.e.}, monsoon winds) instead of bellows. }

It is noteworthy that there were female alchemists at a time when females were generally limited to ``kitchen, children and church'', and that the work of these female alchemists was highly respected by their male colleagues. \Name{Maria Prophetissa} and \Name{Cleopatra the Alchemist} (Alexandria, ca. 3rd century AD, not related to the Ptolemaic queens) may be the most well-known of them.
